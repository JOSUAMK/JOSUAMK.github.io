# THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH INFORMATICS IN SURGERIES


## INTRODUCTION 

Medical informatics or health informatics is the intersection of technology and the healthcare’s system. It implicates the use of technology and data analytics to help in tacking clinical decision, enhance patient outcomes, streamline processes and more. In the surgical field nowadays, health informatics has a capital importance. 

## ADVANTAGES

- One of the main profits of health informatics in surgery is that it gives use the ability to produce more efficient and accurate record keeping. Electronic health records help for a better understanding and gives a great overview of the patient's medical history, which is available to surgeons and all other healthcare providers in real-time involved in the patient's treatment. This is helpful in preventing medical errors and improving patients’ safety by providing a complete set of the patient's medical history and current health status.

- Another key provided by health informatics in surgery is its competence to assist in the preparation and planning of surgical procedures. With the use of computer simulations, AI and other digital tools, surgeons are virtually able to practice and visualize an operation before performing it in real life. This can truly help to reduce errors and improve outcomes.

- One specific way in which health informatics is been used in surgery is through the implementation of computer-assisted surgery (CAS). CAS applies to the use of computer technology to support in the performance of a surgical procedure. This can include the use of robots to execute the surgery, or the use of computer programs to lead the surgeon during the procedure. CAS has the potential to enhance the accuracy and precision of surgeries, as well as reduce the risk of complications.

## CONCLUSION 

To sum-up, health informatics helps surgeons significantly in assisting, planning and executing surgical procedures also, it improves patient outcomes and increase accuracy and precision of surgeries using CAS. As healthcare systems continue to adopt and integrate technology into their operations, the role of health informatics will only continue to grow and evolve.
